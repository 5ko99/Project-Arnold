        <item>1.Begin in a pushup position, with your weight supported by your hands
            and toes. Flexing the knee and hip, bring one leg until the knee is
            approximately under the hip. This will be your starting position. \n
2.Explosively reverse the positions of your legs, extending the bent leg until the
            leg is straight and supported by the toe, and bringing the other foot
            up with the hip and knee flexed. Repeat in an alternating fashion for
            20-30 seconds. \n</item>
        <item>1.Lie face down on a hyperextension bench, tucking your ankles securely
            under the footpads. \n
2.Adjust the upper pad if possible so your upper thighs lie flat across the wide pad,
            leaving enough room for you to bend at the waist without any restriction. \n
3.With your body straight, cross your arms in front of you (my preference) or behind your
            head. This will be your starting position. Tip: You can also hold a weight plate
            for extra resistance in front of you under your crossed arms. \n
4.Start bending forward slowly at the waist as far as you can while keeping your back flat.
            Inhale as you perform this movement. Keep moving forward until you feel a nice
            stretch on the hamstrings and you can no longer keep going without a rounding of
            the back. Tip: Never round the back as you perform this exercise. Also, some people
            can go farther than others. The key thing is that you go as far as your body allows
            you to without rounding the back. \n
5.Slowly raise your torso back to the initial position as you inhale. Tip: Avoid the temptation
            to arch your back past a straight line. Also, do not swing the torso at any time
            in order to protect the back from injury. \n
6.Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions. \n
</item>
        <item>1.Begin with the barbell supported on top of the traps. The chest should be up and the
            head facing forward. Adopt a hip-width stance with the feet turned out as needed. \n
2.Descend by flexing the knees, refraining from moving the hips back as much as possible. This requires
            that the knees travel forward. Ensure that they stay align with the feet. The goal is to
            keep the torso as upright as possible. \n
3.Continue all the way down, keeping the weight on the front of the heel. At the moment the upper legs
            contact the lower legs reverse the motion, driving the weight upward. \n</item>
        <item>1.Using a leg press machine, sit down on the machine and place your legs on the platform
            directly in front of you at a medium (shoulder width) foot stance. (Note: For the purposes
            of this discussion we will use the medium stance described above which targets overall development;
            however you can choose any of the three stances described in the foot positioning section). \n
2.Lower the safety bars holding the weighted platform in place and press the platform all the way up until
            your legs are fully extended in front of you. Tip: Make sure that you do not lock your knees.
            Your torso and the legs should make a perfect 90-degree angle. This will be your starting position. \n
3.As you inhale, slowly lower the platform until your upper and lower legs make a 90-degree angle. \n
4.Pushing mainly with the heels of your feet and using the quadriceps go back to the starting position
            as you exhale. \n
5.Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions and ensure to lock the safety pins properly once
            you are done. You do not want that platform falling on you fully loaded. \n</item>
         <item>1.Approach the bar so that it is centered over your feet. Your feet should be about hip-width apart.
            Bend at the hip to grip the bar at shoulder-width allowing your shoulder blades to protract. Typically, you would use an alternating grip. \n
2.With your feet and your grip set, take a big breath and then lower your hips and flex the knees until your shins contact the bar.
            Look forward with your head. Keep your chest up and your back arched, and begin driving through the heels to move the weight upward. \n
3.After the bar passes the knees aggressively pull the bar back, pulling your shoulder blades together as you drive your hips forward into the bar. \n
4.Lower the bar by bending at the hips and guiding it to the floor. \n</item>
        <item>1.Stand with your torso upright holding two dumbbells in your hands by your sides.
            This will be your starting position. \n
2.Step forward with your right leg around 2 feet or so from the foot being left stationary behind
            and lower your upper body down, while keeping the torso upright and maintaining balance.
            Inhale as you go down. Note: As in the other exercises, do not allow your knee to go forward
            beyond your toes as you come down, as this will put undue stress on the knee joint. Make sure
            that you keep your front shin perpendicular to the ground. \n
3.Using mainly the heel of your foot, push up and go back to the starting position as you exhale. \n
4.Repeat the movement for the recommended amount of repetitions and then perform with the left leg. \n</item>
        <item>1.Stand in an athletic position, with your feet shoulder-width apart, at a comfortable distance from the box. \n
2.When you’re ready to jump, drop quickly into a quarter squat, then extend your hips, swing your arms, and push your
            feet through the floor to propel yourself onto the box. \n
3.Don’t “stick” your landing. Instead, envision the way cats land when they jump from something—you,
            too, should try to land this quietly. \n

        <item>1.Grasp a bar using an overhand grip (palms facing down). You may need some wrist
            wraps if using a significant amount of weight. \n
2.Stand with your torso straight and your legs spaced using a shoulder width or narrower stance.
            The knees should be slightly bent. This is your starting position. \n
3.Keeping the knees stationary, lower the barbell to over the top of your feet by bending at the waist
            while keeping your back straight. Keep moving forward as if you were going to pick something
            from the floor until you feel a stretch on the hamstrings. Inhale as you perform this movement. \n
4.Start bringing your torso up straight again by extending your hips until you are back at
            the starting position. Exhale as you perform this movement. \n
5.Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions. \n</item>
