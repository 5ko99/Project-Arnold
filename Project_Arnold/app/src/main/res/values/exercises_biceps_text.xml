        <item>1.Stand up with your torso upright while holding a cable curl bar that is attached to a low pulley.
            Grab the cable bar at shoulder width and keep the elbows close to the torso. The palm of your hands should be facing up (supinated grip). This will be your starting position. \n
2.While holding the upper arms stationary, curl the weights while contracting the biceps as you breathe out.
            Only the forearms should move. Continue the movement until your biceps are fully contracted and the bar is at shoulder level.
            Hold the contracted position for a second as you squeeze the muscle. \n
3.Slowly begin to bring the curl bar back to starting position as your breathe in. \n
4.Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions. \n</item>

2.Now, keeping the upper arms stationary, exhale and curl the weights while contracting your biceps.
            Continue to raise the weights until your biceps are fully contracted and the dumbbells are at shoulder level.
            Hold the contracted position for a brief pause as you squeeze your biceps. \n

            The palm of your hands should be facing up (supinated grip). This will be your starting position. \n
2.While holding the upper arms stationary, curl the weights while contracting the biceps as you breathe out.
            Only the forearms should move. Continue the movement until your biceps are fully contracted and
            the bar is at shoulder level. Hold the contracted position for a second as you squeeze the muscle. \n

        <item>1.Sit down on a flat bench with one dumbbell in front of you between your legs.
            Your legs should be spread with your knees bent and feet on the floor. \n
2.Use your right arm to pick the dumbbell up. Place the back of your right upper arm on the top of your inner right thigh.
            Rotate the palm of your hand until it is facing forward away from your thigh.
            Tip: Your arm should be extended and the dumbbell should be above the floor. This will be your starting position. \n
3.While holding the upper arm stationary, curl the weights forward while contracting the biceps as you breathe out.
            Only the forearms should move. Continue the movement until your biceps are fully contracted and
            the dumbbells are at shoulder level. Tip: At the top of the movement make sure that the little finger
            of your arm is higher than your thumb. This guarantees a good contraction. Hold the contracted position
            for a second as you squeeze the biceps. \n
4.Slowly begin to bring the dumbbells back to starting position as your breathe in. Caution: Avoid swinging motions at any time.
5.Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions. Then repeat the movement with the left arm. \n</item>
        <item>1.Stand up straight with a dumbbell in each hand. Your hands should be down at your side with your palms facing in. \n
2.While keeping your palms facing in and without twisting your arm, curl the dumbbell of the right arm up towards your left shoulder as you exhale.
            Touch the top of the dumbbell to your shoulder and hold the contraction for a second. \n
3.Slowly lower the dumbbell along the same path as you inhale and then repeat the same movement for the left arm. \n
4.Continue alternating in this fashion until the recommended amount of repetitions is performed for each arm. \n</item>
        <item>1.Grab the pull-up bar with the palms facing forward using the prescribed grip. Note on grips:
            For a wide grip, your hands need to be spaced out at a distance wider than your shoulder width.
            For a medium grip, your hands need to be spaced out at a distance equal to your shoulder width and for
            a close grip at a distance smaller than your shoulder width. \n
2.As you have both arms extended in front of you holding the bar at the chosen grip width, bring your torso back around 30 degrees
            or so while creating a curvature on your lower back and sticking your chest out. This is your starting position. \n
3.Pull your torso up until the bar touches your upper chest by drawing the shoulders and the upper arms down and back.
            Exhale as you perform this portion of the movement. Tip: Concentrate on squeezing the back muscles once
            you reach the full contracted position. The upper torso should remain stationary as it moves through space
            and only the arms should move. The forearms should do no other work other than hold the bar. \n
4.After a second on the contracted position, start to inhale and slowly lower your torso back
            to the starting position when your arms are fully extended and the lats are fully stretched. \n
5.Repeat this motion for the prescribed amount of repetitions. \n</item>

5.Repeat this motion for the prescribed amount of repetitions. \n</item>
        <item>1.To perform this movement you will need a preacher bench and an E-Z bar. Grab the E-Z curl bar at the close
            inner handle (either have someone hand you the bar which is preferable or grab the bar
            from the front bar rest provided by most preacher benches). The palm of your hands
            should be facing forward and they should be slightly tilted inwards due to the shape of the bar. \n
2.With the upper arms positioned against the preacher bench pad and the chest against it, hold
            the E-Z Curl Bar at shoulder length. This will be your starting position. \n
3.As you breathe in, slowly lower the bar until your upper arm is extended and the biceps is fully stretched. \n
4.As you exhale, use the biceps to curl the weight up until your biceps is fully contracted and the bar is at shoulder height.
            Squeeze the biceps hard and hold this position for a second. \n
5.Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions. \n</item>
        <item>1.Stand up with your torso upright and a dumbbell on each hand being held at arms length. The elbows should be close to the torso. \n
2.The palms of the hands should be facing your torso. This will be your starting position. \n
3.Now, while holding your upper arm stationary, exhale and curl the weight forward while contracting the biceps.
            Continue to raise the weight until the biceps are fully contracted and the dumbbell is at shoulder level.
            Hold the contracted position for a brief moment as you squeeze the biceps. Tip:
            Focus on keeping the elbow stationary and only moving your forearm. \n
4.After the brief pause, inhale and slowly begin the lower the dumbbells back down to the starting position. \n
5.Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions. \n</item>
