        <item>1.Begin standing with your legs shoulder width apart. \n
2.Place your hands on the floor and kick your legs back so you end up with your stomach and thighs on the floor.
            Your elbows should be bent. \n
3.From this position, press up like you are doing a push-up and push your hips up. \n
4.Jump your feet under your hips and stand. \n
5.Finish the movement by jumping in the air and bringing your hands over your head. \n
6.Repeat. \n</item>
        <item>1.For this exercise you will need access to parallel bars. To get yourself into the
            starting position, hold your body at arms length (arms locked) above the bars. \n
2.While breathing in, lower yourself slowly with your torso leaning forward around 30 degrees
            or so and your elbows flared out slightly until you feel a slight stretch in the chest. \n
3.Once you feel the stretch, use your chest to bring your body back to the starting position
            as you breathe out. Tip: Remember to squeeze the chest at the top of the movement for a second. \n
4.Repeat the movement for the prescribed amount of repetitions. \n</item>
        <item>1.Position a flat bench between two low pulleys so that when you are laying
            on it, your chest will be lined up with the cable pulleys. \n
2.Lay flat on the bench and keep your feet on the ground. \n
3.Have someone hand you the handles on each hand. You will grab each single handle attachment with a palms up grip. \n
4.Extend your arms by your side with a slight bend on your elbows. Tip: You will keep this bend constant
            through the whole movement. Your arms should be parallel to the floor. This is your starting position. \n
5.Now start lifting the arms in a semi-circle motion directly in front of you by pulling the cables together
            until both hands meet at the top of the movement. Squeeze your chest as you perform this motion and breathe
            out during this movement. Also, hold the contraction for a second at the top. Tip: When performed correctly,
            at the top position of this movement, your arms should be perpendicular to your torso and the floor
            touching above your chest. \n
6.Slowly come back to the starting position. \n
7.Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions. \n</item>
        <item>1.Lie back on an incline bench with a dumbbell in each hand atop your thighs.
            The palms of your hands will be facing each other. \n
2.Then, using your thighs to help push the dumbbells up, lift the dumbbells one at a
            time so that you can hold them at shoulder width. \n
3.Once you have the dumbbells raised to shoulder width, rotate your wrists forward so
            that the palms of your hands are facing away from you. This will be your starting position. \n
4.Be sure to keep full control of the dumbbells at all times. Then breathe out and push
            the dumbbells up with your chest. \n
5.Lock your arms at the top, hold for a second, and then start slowly lowering the weight. Tip Ideally,
            lowering the weights should take about twice as long as raising them. \n
6.Repeat the movement for the prescribed amount of repetitions. \n
7.When you are done, place the dumbbells back on your thighs and then on the floor.
            This is the safest manner to release the dumbbells. \n</item>
        <item>Preparation \n
Sit on seat with chest approximately height of horizontal handles. If available, push foot lever until lever is within
            grasping range. Grasp handles with wide overhand grip; elbows out to sides just below shoulders. Release foot lever. \n
Execution \n
Press lever until arms are extended. Return weight until chest muscles are slightly stretched. \n
            Repeat. \n</item>
        <item>1.Regular bench presses often end up causing joint pain, but the reverse grip bench press (RGBP)
            can heal your joints and improve your pressing strength. \n
2.If you do not have a spotter, you can safely do the RGBP using safety pins. \n
3.Like anything else, the RGBP takes practice. \n</item>
        <item>1.To get yourself into the starting position, place the pulleys on a high position (above your head),
            select the resistance to be used and hold the pulleys in each hand. \n
2.Step forward in front of an imaginary straight line between both pulleys while pulling your arms together in front
            of you. Your torso should have a small forward bend from the waist. This will be your starting position. \n
3.With a slight bend on your elbows in order to prevent stress at the biceps tendon, extend your arms to the side
            (straight out at both sides) in a wide arc until you feel a stretch on your chest. Breathe in as you perform
            this portion of the movement. Tip: Keep in mind that throughout the movement, the arms and torso should remain
            stationary; the movement should only occur at the shoulder joint. \n
4.Return your arms back to the starting position as you breathe out. Make sure to use the same arc of motion used to
            lower the weights. \n
5.Hold for a second at the starting position and repeat the movement for the prescribed amount of repetitions. \n</item>
        <item>1.Lie on the floor face down and place your hands about 36 inches apart while holding your torso up at arms length. \n
2.Next, lower yourself downward until your chest almost touches the floor as you inhale. \n
3.Now breathe out and press your upper body back up to the starting position while squeezing your chest. \n
4.After a brief pause at the top contracted position, you can begin to lower yourself downward again for as many repetitions as needed. \n</item>
        <item>1.Sit on the machine with your back flat on the pad. \n
2.Take hold of the handles. Tip: Your upper arms should be positioned parallel to the floor; adjust the machine accordingly.
            This will be your starting position. \n
3.Push the handles together slowly as you squeeze your chest in the middle. Breathe out during this part of
            the motion and hold the contraction for a second. \n
4.Return back to the starting position slowly as you inhale until your chest muscles are fully stretched. \n
5.Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions. \n</item>
        <item>1.Secure your legs at the end of the decline bench and lie down with a dumbbell on each hand
            on top of your thighs. The palms of your hand will be facing each other. \n
2.Once you are laying down, move the dumbbells in front of you at shoulder width. \n
3.Once at shoulder width, rotate your wrists forward so that the palms of your hands are facing away from you.
            This will be your starting position. \n
4.Bring down the weights slowly to your side as you breathe out. Keep full control of the dumbbells at all times.
            Tip: Throughout the motion, the forearms should always be perpendicular to the floor. \n
5.As you breathe out, push the dumbbells up using your pectoral muscles. Lock your arms in the contracted position,
            squeeze your chest, hold for a second and then start coming down slowly. Tip: It should
            take at least twice as long to go down than to come up.. \n
6.Repeat the movement for the prescribed amount of repetitions of your training program. \n</item>
        <item>1.Lie down on a flat bench with a dumbbell in each hand resting on top of your thighs. The palms of
            your hands will be facing each other. \n
2.Then, using your thighs to help raise the dumbbells up, lift the dumbbells one at a time so that you can hold them
            in front of you at shoulder width. \n
3.Once at shoulder width, rotate your wrists forward so that the palms of your hands are facing away from you.
            The dumbbells should be just to the sides of your chest, with your upper arm and forearm creating a
            90 degree angle. Be sure to maintain full control of the dumbbells at all times. This will be your
            starting position. \n
4.Then, as you breathe out, use your chest to push the dumbbells up. Lock your arms at the top of the lift and
            squeeze your chest, hold for a second and then begin coming down slowly. Tip: Ideally, lowering the
            weight should take about twice as long as raising it. \n
5.Repeat the movement for the prescribed amount of repetitions of your training program. \n</item>
        <item>1.Secure your legs at the end of the decline bench and slowly lay down on the bench. \n
2.Using a medium width grip (a grip that creates a 90-degree angle in the middle of the movement between
            the forearms and the upper arms), lift the bar from the rack and hold it straight over you with
            your arms locked. The arms should be perpendicular to the floor. This will be your starting position.
            Tip: In order to protect your rotator cuff, it is best if you have a spotter help you lift the barbell
            off the rack. \n
3.As you breathe in, come down slowly until you feel the bar on your lower chest. \n
4.After a second pause, bring the bar back to the starting position as you breathe out and push the
            bar using your chest muscles. Lock your arms and squeeze your chest in the contracted position,
            hold for a second and then start coming down slowly again. Tip: It should take at least twice
            as long to go down than to come up). \n
5.Repeat the movement for the prescribed amount of repetitions. \n
6.When you are done, place the bar back in the rack. \n</item>
        <item>1.Lie down on a flat bench with a dumbbell on each hand resting on top of your thighs.
            The palms of your hand will be facing each other. \n
2.Then using your thighs to help raise the dumbbells, lift the dumbbells one at a time so you can hold
            them in front of you at shoulder width with the palms of your hands facing each other. Raise
            the dumbbells up like you are pressing them, but stop and hold just before you lock out. This
            will be your starting position. \n
3.With a slight bend on your elbows in order to prevent stress at the biceps tendon, lower your arms out
            at both sides in a wide arc until you feel a stretch on your chest. Breathe in as you perform this
            portion of the movement. Tip: Keep in mind that throughout the movement, the arms should remain stationary;
            the movement should only occur at the shoulder joint. \n
4.Return your arms back to the starting position as you squeeze your chest muscles and breathe out. Tip: Make sure
            to use the same arc of motion used to lower the weights. \n
5.Hold for a second at the contracted position and repeat the movement for the prescribed amount of repetitions. \n</item>
        <item>1.Place a dumbbell standing up on a flat bench. \n
2.Ensuring that the dumbbell stays securely placed at the top of the bench, lie perpendicular to the bench
            (torso across it as in forming a cross) with only your shoulders lying on the surface. Hips should
            be below the bench and legs bent with feet firmly on the floor. The head will be off the bench as well. \n
3.Grasp the dumbbell with both hands and hold it straight over your chest at arms length. Both palms should be pressing
            against the underside one of the sides of the dumbbell. This will be your starting position. \n
Caution: Always ensure that the dumbbell used for this exercise is secure. Using a dumbbell with loose plates can result
            in the dumbbell falling apart and falling on your face. \n

4.While keeping your arms straight, lower the weight slowly in an arc behind your head while breathing in until
            you feel a stretch on the chest. \n
5.At that point, bring the dumbbell back to the starting position using the arc through which the weight was
            lowered and exhale as you perform this movement. \n
6.Hold the weight on the initial position for a second and repeat the motion for the prescribed number of repetitions. \n</item>
        <item>1.Lie back on a flat bench. Using a medium width grip (a grip that creates a 90-degree angle in the middle of
            the movement between the forearms and the upper arms), lift the bar from the rack and hold it straight over you with
            your arms locked. This will be your starting position. \n
2.From the starting position, breathe in and begin coming down slowly until the bar touches your middle chest. \n
3.After a brief pause, push the bar back to the starting position as you breathe out. Focus on pushing the bar using
            your chest muscles. Lock your arms and squeeze your chest in the contracted position at the top of the motion,
            hold for a second and then start coming down slowly again. Tip: Ideally, lowering the weight should take about twice
            as long as raising it. \n
4.Repeat the movement for the prescribed amount of repetitions. \n
5.When you are done, place the bar back in the rack. \n</item>
        <item>1.Load the bar to an appropriate weight for your training. \n
2.Lay on the bench with your feet flat on the ground, driving through to your hips. Your back should
            be arched, and your shoulder blades retracted. \n
3.Take a medium, pronated grip covering the rings on the bar. Remove the bar from the rack, holding
            the weight above your chest with your arms extended. This will be your starting position. \n
4.Lower the bar to the sternum by flexing the elbows. Maintain control and do not bounce the bar off of
            your chest. Your lats should stay tight and elbows slightly drawn in. \n
5.After touching your torso with the bar, extend the elbows to return the bar to the starting position. \n</item>
